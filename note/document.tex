\section{Introduction}

Hiveplots (HPs) are a way of visualizing large networks which allow
for easy assesment and comparison of their structural properties.
\cite{krzywinski2012hive}

Although graphical user interfaces for the creation of HPs may be
easier to use or learn, an Application Programming Interface
(API) provides for more flexibility and automation which are boosted
by the use of a powerful programming language. Python is such a
language: mature and popular, it has a large number of libraries
related to data analysis in general and life sciences and
bioinformatics in particular. For example, it is easy to leverage the
functionality provided by the powerful NetworkX library, while having
no dependencies to it.

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a modularized format for describing
two-dimensional vector graphics. It is based on XML and developed by
the World Wide Web Consortium. \cite{McCormack:11:SVG} While the
requirements of a HP can be met with the most basic shapes supported
by SVG, the design of Pyveplot allows a programmer to take full
advantage of the wide array of capabilities of the graphics format.

This procedural, imperative way of creating and linking the elements of a plot may
have better readability than a declarative approach.

\section{Object Oriented Approach}

The Object Oriented (OO) approach to the API makes the creation of a
plot a straightforward process. A HP consists of
\begin{itemize}
\item radialy distributed linear axes
\item nodes along those axes
\item conections among those nodes
\end{itemize}
The API provides the corresponding objects: a {\bfseries Hiveplot} object
which contains an arbitrary number of {\bfseries Axis} objects which in
turn contain an arbitrary number of {\bfseries Node} objects, and a method
to connect them.

The ``Hiveplot.connect()'' method draws edges as bezier curves. Start and
end points are set by the ``Axis.add\_node()'' method, using the placement
information of the axis and a specified offset from its start point.

Control points are set at the same distance from the start (or end)
point of an axis as their corresponding nodes, but along an invisible
axis that shares its origin but diverges by a given angle.

  \caption{Hiveplot of Erdos-Renyi graph trivially generated using
    NetworkX. Showing off some SVG goodness: paths that make edges
    and axes can have any width, color or dash pattern, any valid SVG
    element can be used as a node. Define as many axes as you need,
    place them anywhere in the SVG canvas.}\label{fig:01}
\end{figure}

The ``Drawing'' structural component of the underlying svgwrite
library is available through the ``dwg'' (short for drawing) property
of {\bfseries Hiveplot}, {\bfseries Axis} and {\bfseries Node}
objects. Any other shape or valid SVG element may be added to them.
This allows for a very flexible use of marks, tags, ticks, etc., as is
shown in Figure \ref{fig:01}
